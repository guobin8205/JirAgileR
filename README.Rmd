## Objective

The **JirAgileR** R package has the mission to bring the power of the project management tool `r emo::ji("wrench")` **JIRA** to **R**. By doing so, users benefit from the best capabilities of both platforms. More specifically, the package is a wrapper around [JIRA's REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/rest-apis/), allowing users to easily analyze JIRA projects and issues from within R. The underlying powertrain of the API is the *__Jira Query Language__ (JQL)*. You can find more information about it [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/blog/2015/06/search-jira-like-a-boss-with-jql). You can find a cheatsheet [here](https://3kllhk1ibq34qk6sp3bhtox1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/atlassian-jql-cheat-sheet-2.pdf).

The focus of this package lies in the following workflow aspects:

- __Import__
- __Tidy__

Hence, for easy transformation and manipulation, each function returns a `data.frame` with **tidy data**, following main rules where each row is a single observation of an **issue** or a **project**, each column is a variable and each value must have its own cell. Thus, it integrates well with both the `dplyr` and `data.table` R libraries. This also allows for an easy integration with tabular data.

More information about the package can be found at the following link: [https://matbmeijer.github.io/JirAgileR/](https://matbmeijer.github.io/JirAgileR/).

### Functionalities as of `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d of %B, %Y")`
1. Extract all project names with their basic information (e.g. Name, ID, Key, Type, Category etc.).
```{r unordered_list, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
jira_fields <- list("Retrieve all issues specific to a user defined JIRA query with hand-picked fields and all the associated information. Currently, the package supports the following JIRA fields:" = JirAgileR::supported_jql_fields())

for (name in names(jira_fields)) {
    cat("2.", name, '\n', paste0('   - _', jira_fields[[name]], '_\n'))
}
```

##### Note

- To get all the information about the supported JQL fields visit the following [link](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-desk-cloud/docs/advanced-search-reference-jql-fields/).
The package supports extracting comments, yet as one issue may contain multiple comments, the `data.frame` is flattened to a combination of issues and comments. Thus, the information of an issue may be repeated the number of comments each issue has.

### Roadmap

- `r emo::ji("black_square_button")` Define integrated *Reference Classes* within the package
- `r emo::ji("black_square_button")` Include plotting graphs `r emo::ji("bar_chart")`
- `r emo::ji("black_square_button")` Ability to obtain all available JIRA fields of a project
- `r emo::ji("check")` Added `get_jira_dashboards()` function to retrieve JIRA dashboards
- `r emo::ji("check")` Added `get_jira_permissions()` function to retrieve JIRA user permissions
- `r emo::ji("check")` Added `get_jira_groups()` function to retrieve JIRA groups
- `r emo::ji("check")` Added `get_jira_server_info()` function to retrieve JIRA server information
- `r emo::ji("check")` Remove `data.table` dependency
- `r emo::ji("check")` Ability to save domain, username & password as secret tokens in environment `r emo::ji("closed_lock_with_key")`
- `r emo::ji("check")` Include *pipes* to facilitate analysis
- `r emo::ji("check")` Improve package robustness
- `r emo::ji("check")` Include http status error codes
- `r emo::ji("check")` Give user visibility of supported fields

## Installation

You can install the CRAN release version of JirAgileR following this `R` command:

``` {r, eval=FALSE} 
install.packages("JirAgileR")
```


You can also install the latest release of this package from [Github](https://github.com/matbmeijer/JirAgileR) with the following commands in `R`:

```{r, eval=FALSE} 
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matbmeijer/JirAgileR")
```


## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to obtain a simple table of issues of a project and create a tabular report. Most of the times, you will need a username and your password to authenticate in your domain. Possible fields to obtain (which will populate the `data.frame` columns) can be found [here](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-desk-cloud/docs/advanced-search-reference-jql-fields/).

``` {r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(JirAgileR, quietly = T)
library(knitr, quietly = T)
library(dplyr, quietly = T)

# Save credentials to pass them only one time
save_jira_credentials(domain = "https://bugreports.qt.io")

# Get full list of projects in domain
get_jira_projects() %>% 
  select(key, name)  %>% 
  kable(row.names = F, padding = 0)

# Retrieve the issues from a single project - in this case the project QTWB from bugreports.qt.io. See documentation to define which fields to see
get_jira_issues(jql_query = "project='QTWB'",
                fields = c("summary","created", "status")) %>% 
  select(key, summary, created, status_name, status_description, status_statuscategory_name) %>%
  head(2) %>%
  kable(row.names = F, padding = 0)

```
